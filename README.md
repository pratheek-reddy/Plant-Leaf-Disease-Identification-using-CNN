# Plant Disease Detection From Leaf Images

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

In this project, we proposed a novel plant leaf disease identification
model based on a deep convolutional neural network (Deep CNN).
The Deep CNN model is trained using an open dataset of plant
leaves and background images.

### Main features of Project
- build_optimal_network algorithm
- train_network_to_convergence algorithm
- Transfer of CNN model to TensorFlow lite
- Stand-alone application


## Conclusion
- This system was built by training on open data set.
- This application can be developed to be deployed on remote devices like drones and cameras.
- Collecting user data for future applications.
- Training model with real life data set.
